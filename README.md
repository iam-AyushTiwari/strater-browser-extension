# Strater YouTube Extension

This is a browser extension that helps users create notes and watch videos on YouTube more efficiently. It adds a button to the YouTube video page that, when clicked, opens a popup window with a text box for writing notes and an iframe for watching the video. The notes are sent to the user's Strater account when they click the "Send to Strater" button. The extension also adds a "Watch" button that opens the video in a new tab.

The extension is designed for users who watch a lot of YouTube videos and want to be able to quickly take notes on the videos they watch. The extension is easy to use and makes it fast to take notes on videos.

The extension is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and uses the YouTube API to get the video title and video ID. The extension also uses the Strater API to send the notes to the user's account.

To install the extension, go to the Chrome Web Store and search for "Strater YouTube Extension". Click the "Add to Chrome" button to install the extension. Once installed, you can find the extension in the top right corner of your browser window. Click the extension to open the popup window and start taking notes on YouTube videos.

The extension is free and open source. If you have any questions or need help, feel free to open an issue on GitHub or email us at [letsmailayushtiwari@gmail.com](mailto:hello@strater.in).
